			Star Trek: Deep Space Nine takes place in the 24th century, two years after the Battle at Wolf 359, and it runs concurrently with parts of The Next Generation, Voyager, and three Star Trek films. DS9 is the fourth Star Trek series, and it ran from 1993-1999. The show broke from the &quot;norm&quot; in three main ways: it took place on a space station instead of a starship, it experimented with serialized storytelling, and its stories were comparatively &quot;darker&quot; than the more idealized future that was envisioned by Gene Roddenberry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Critics of the show say that the stationary nature of a space station made the show boring, since the crew wasn't always traveling to new worlds. This is an assertion with which I disagree - I think being on a station is certainly different than previous <em>Trek</em>, but I think the stories were just as engaging. Many people also find the darker storytelling to be antithetical to their vision of what <em>Star Trek</em> &quot;should&quot; be. Personally, I find these stories to be more realistic and richer, because they allow us to explore humanity's flaws as well as their strengths.
		</p>
		<p>
			The last defining characteristic of this series is the serialized storytelling. Instead of each episode being self-contained and having everything wrapped up before the credits roll, this series uses some multiple-episode story arcs, including a 10-episode arc for the series finale. Before this series, a two-part episode was the longest story line that <em>Trek</em> was willing to use, and those were usually only reserved for season finales or premieres.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, when I first started watching this series in 1993, I honestly didn't like it. But it really grew on me, and it has since become my favorite all-time <em>Star Trek</em> series.

	<h2 id="URAR" style="text-align:center">Understanding Ratings and Recommendations</h2>

	<p>
		Everyone has different tastes and opinions, and my opinions certainly aren't always popular. To help combat that, a &quot;final score&quot; on any episode is an average of my rating and the ratings from 3 other independent sources, including IMDB. Though, my rating is weighted a little higher in that calculation, because this is my website, after all. In addition to the ratings, I also provide a &quot;Watch Recommendation&quot; which doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the quality of the episode. Rather, the watch recommendation is based on how important the episode is to the overall story of the entire series, whether that episode is good or bad. See below for more details.

		<li>Generally speaking, you can safely read any of the episode guides without fear of spoiling any plot reveals or twists in a single episode.</li>

		<li><em>HOWEVER,</em> this show is over 25 years old, so some things just can't be a surprise any more. Some of the episode descriptions or pictures may hint at things you might not have otherwise known if this is your first time watching. Also, certain other major developments in the series can't and won't be hidden - for example, if you didn't know that Worf becomes a main character in the show starting in Season 4, well, now you do!</li>
